# FallingBlocksGame
a falling block game where matching 3 or more of the same colored blocks in a row causes them to disappear

Contains a first attempt js file as well as a second attempt all-in-one HTML page

This code creates a canvas element and a 2D array to represent the grid of blocks. It defines functions for drawing the blocks on the canvas, checking for matching blocks, and updating the grid. It also includes a main game loop that clears the canvas, draws the blocks, checks for matches, updates the grid, and then requests the next frame using the requestAnimationFrame() function.
